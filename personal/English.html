                My name is Loey (Shang-Yi Liao). I am a student currently studying in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature at Tsinghua University, with a minor in the Department of Economics. I am passionate about anime and digital arts; therefore, I strive to bring my love of anime and my sense of expression into photography and painting. My digital arts are in the Portfolio on this website. I always tend to combine Japanese black-and-white comic style with Western Gothic elements in my drawings. Although the characters I create may seem a bit creepy, if you look carefully, turns out they are actually cute! I feel like my work is somehow representative of who I am. I love wearing white and black with lots of bows or ruffles and lace. Maybe it’s the way I dress or my tattoos and piercings that make people like I am a mean and strange person, but I have a genuine heart! Although I am not talkative, willing to make friends with everyone!
